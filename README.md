My first data project: cleaning, analyzing, and showing data in Jupyter Notebook
Final
When I went through the Titanic data, I wanted to understand what really made the difference between life and death. The numbers told a clear story: your chance to survive was mostly about where your cabin was.

First and second class passengers were in a much better position. Most kids from those classes made it, and many adults too. But in third class, it was a tragedy. Most adults didn’t survive, and even the children had almost no chance.

The 'women and children first' rule did matter, but only inside each class. Women survived more than men, and kids more than adults — but again, mostly if they were in first or second class. In third class, this rule was almost invisible.

In the end, survival wasn’t so much about your age or gender. It was about your ticket and where you stayed on the ship. Being in third class, deep down on the lower decks, meant you had far less time and almost no chance to reach the lifeboats
